## About

I'm a GenAI Engineer specializing in Large Language Models and RAG architectures, currently pursuing my M.Tech in Computer Science at NIT Durgapur (CGPA: 9.0). With 2+ years of industry experience at HCLTech and recent work with the Indian Army on AI-driven predictive systems, I focus on building production-grade AI applications that solve real-world problems.

My work centers on developing end-to-end LLM solutions using modern frameworks and deploying scalable systems that deliver measurable impact.
